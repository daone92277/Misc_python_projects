        <h2>Pig Latin:</h2>
            <p>Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which 
                words in English are altered, usually by adding a 
                fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant 
                or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding 
                a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. The objective is to 
                conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. 
                The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a 
                form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its 
                English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.
